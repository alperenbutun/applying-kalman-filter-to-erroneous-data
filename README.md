Applying Kalman Filter to a List of Data with Error

Kalman Filter is a form of predictor-corrector.

Using the algorithm in this repository, a really nice estimation can be made over a list of data with error.

There is one file.
* Kalman Filter.pdf: File showing the algorithm and plot of estimation.
