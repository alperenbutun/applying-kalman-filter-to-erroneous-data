Applying Kalman Filter to a List of Data with Error

Kalman Filter is a form of predictor-corrector. Using the algorithm in this repository, a really nice estimation can be made over a list of data with error.

There are three files in total.
1 - Kalman Filter.pdf: File showing the algorithm and plot of estimation.
2 - KalmanDataX      : File showing the algorithm and the filter's x variable which is keeping estimation data.
3 - KalmanDataY      : File showing the algorithm and the filter's y variable which is keeping the original measurement data.
