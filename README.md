Applying Kalman Filter to a List of Data with Error

Kalman Filter is a form of predictor-corrector.

Using the algorithm in this repository, a really nice estimation can be made over a list of data with error.

There are three files in total.
* Kalman Filter.pdf: File showing the algorithm and plot of estimation.
* KalmanDataZ.pdf: File showing the algorithm and the filter's z variable which is keeping the original measurement data.
* KalmanDataX.pdf: File showing the algorithm and the filter's x variable which is keeping estimation data.
